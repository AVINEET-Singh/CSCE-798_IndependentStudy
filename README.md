# CSCE:798 Independent Study Report
***By Avineet Kumar Singh***
## Topic: Analyze change in policy document.
### Problem Statement: 
Terms of service(ex: privacy policy) documents are usually very lengthy and difficult for consumers to read and understand it completely. They use legal terms and are ambiguous in nature making it furthermore difficult for consumer with little knowledge of such terms. 

Tools like ‘Pribot’, ‘Compare and Comply‘ solve these problems by summarizing these documents into specific set of topics making it easier for user to understand it.  They also help to compare two legal/policy documents and provide insights of the differences.
However, ‘Pribot’ does not provide the comparison between the previous versions of same policy documents(same organization). In this study, I will try to address these shortcomings.
